Hiring managers skim. Your case study has 30–60 seconds to hook them and 5 minutes to convince them. Use this structure to tell a crisp, credible story.

## Five acts, one page each

**Act 1 — Hook (The billboard)**

- One sentence problem ("Checkout drop-off was 42% on mobile").
- One sentence outcome (quantified).
- A single hero image (final state).
- Your role, timeframe, team, tools.

**Act 2 — Context (Why this mattered)**

- Business goal and constraints (platform, timeline, legacy blockers).
- Audience and key jobs-to-be-done.
- Success metrics you targeted (leading + lagging).

**Act 3 — Approach (How you worked)**

- Show 2–3 pivotal decisions, not every step.
- Evidence snapshots: a messy whiteboard, a quick prototype, a user quote.
- Alternatives you _didn't_ choose and why (demonstrates critical thinking).
- Accessibility and internationalization considerations included early.

**Act 4 — Outcome (What changed)**

- Before/after frames with annotations.
- Movement: where attention goes, how the flow shortens.
- Quant results: conversion, time-on-task, support tickets, NPS shift.
- Deployment footprint: % of the product touched, component reuse.

**Act 5 — Reflection (What you learned)**

- What you'd do with 2 more weeks.
- What surprised you (user behavior, tech constraints).
- A short note from a partner (PM/engineer) if you can include one.

## Make it scannable

- Headlines that tell the story: "Reduced checkout steps from 6 → 3" beats "Checkout redesign."
- Sub-90 word paragraphs, generous white space, numbered captions.

## Evidence over adjectives

Replace "intuitive" with proof: funnel charts, usability metrics, A/B results, or even proxy signals (click maps, task completion).

## Show your judgment

Include one smart trade-off you made (e.g., deferred dark mode to land accessibility fixes first). Explain the reasoning.

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Too long:** Keep the main story to ~5 pages; link deep artifacts separately.
- **Process soup:** Don't parade every tool; focus on decisions and outcomes.
- **No metrics:** If you lack data, use directional proxies and qualitative signals.
- **No credit:** Name collaborators; state _your_ contribution clearly.

## A reusable template

1. **Title:** Outcome-focused headline.
2. **TL;DR card:** Problem, role, timeframe, impact.
3. **Context page:** Goals, users, constraints, success metric.
4. **Approach page:** 2–3 decisions + artifacts.
5. **Outcome page:** Before/after + numbers.
6. **Reflection page:** Lessons + next steps.

**Pro tip:** Write the TL;DR first and design toward it. If you can't summarize the impact in two sentences, you're not ready to publish.
