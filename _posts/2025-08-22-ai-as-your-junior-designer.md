AI won't replace designers, but designers using AI will outpace those who don't. Treat AI like a junior teammate: great at volume, needs direction, and benefits from critique.

## The 7-step loop

1. **Clarify the job**

- Write a one-paragraph brief: user, goal, constraints, success metric.
- Feed real context: brand voice, token palette, sample copy, existing screens.

2. **Ideate wide**

- Prompt for _diverse_ directions: "Give me 5 distinct navigation patterns for a mobile banking app, each with a short rationale and risk."
- Ask for contrasts: conservative, experimental, data-heavy, content-first.

3. **Storyboard and flows**

- Have AI list user flows and edge cases. Then request compact storyboards (frames + captions).
- Use it to enumerate empty, error, loading, and success states you might miss.

4. **Draft content**

- Generate UX copy variants (microcopy, onboarding, empty-state nudges). Provide your tone rules: concise, friendly, no exclamation spam, AA reading level.

5. **Critique & converge**

- Paste your chosen direction and ask for a critique: usability risks, accessibility concerns, cognitive load, and alternative layouts to test.
- Instruct it to find contradictions in your own brief (surprisingly effective).

6. **Spec & handoff**

- Ask for acceptance criteria: "What must be true for this screen to succeed?"
- Generate checklists: interactive states, keyboard navigation, aria labels, tab order.

7. **Experiment scaffolding**

- Have AI draft a simple test plan: hypotheses, tasks, success signals, and sample recruiting screener.

## Prompt patterns that work

- **Role + scenario:** "You're a senior UX designer auditing onboarding for a fitness app..."
- **Constraints first:** tokens, grid, min tap target, platform guidelines.
- **One ask per prompt:** Ideate → critique → refine → spec (don't jumble).

## Where AI shines

- Lists, variants, names, copy drafts, edge-case enumeration, quick personas, test tasks, and converting requirements into checklists.

## Where humans must lead

- Interaction nuance, visual hierarchy, motion timing, ethical judgment, and prioritization.

## Guardrails

- **Privacy:** Never paste sensitive customer data.
- **Copyright:** Treat AI images as concept art; validate licensing before shipping.
- **Bias:** Ask AI to self-audit for stereotypes or exclusionary language.
- **Accessibility:** Request contrast checks, alt text suggestions, and motion-safe alternatives.

**Bottom line:** Use AI to move faster between _thinking_ states. Keep craft and taste human.
