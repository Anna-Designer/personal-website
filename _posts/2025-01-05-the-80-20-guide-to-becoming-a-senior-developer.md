Senior isn't just about code quality—it's about judgment, ownership, and making your team faster. These six behaviors will get you 80% of the way there.

## 1) Own the Outcome, Not Just Your Code

- **Think in business value:** "This feature reduces support tickets by 30%" vs. "I used clean architecture."
- **Scope early:** Ask "What's the minimum that solves the real problem?" before you start coding.
- **Ship incrementally:** Break large features into value-delivering slices.

## 2) Optimize for Team Velocity

- **Code for the next developer:** Clear variable names, obvious structure, helpful comments.
- **Automate friction:** CI/CD, linting, testing, deployment scripts.
- **Reduce context switching:** Batch similar work, minimize meetings, async communication.

## 3) Master the Art of Technical Debt

- **Not all debt is bad:** Strategic shortcuts vs. accidental complexity.
- **Make it visible:** Document decisions and their expiration dates.
- **Pay it down strategically:** Fix what blocks future features first.

## 4) Design for Change

- **SOLID principles:** But don't over-engineer for hypothetical futures.
- **Configuration over code:** Environment variables, feature flags, external config.
- **Separation of concerns:** Business logic, data access, presentation.

## 5) Make Fewer, Better Decisions

- **Reversible vs. irreversible:** Move fast on the former; be deliberate on the latter.
- **Default to simple:** Fewer moving parts = fewer pagers.
- **Bias to delete:** The best code is often code you didn't write.

## 6) Compound by Teaching

- Pair, mob, and document. Reviews are training moments.
- Leave **breadcrumbs** (why, not just what) in code and ADRs.

## A One-Week Seniority Sprint

- **Mon:** Write intent + DR for your current feature.
- **Tue:** Break work into 1–2 day PRs; add feature flag.
- **Wed:** Add metrics (RED/USE) + dashboards; define SLO.
- **Thu:** Ship a canary; verify with smoke tests.
- **Fri:** Share a 1-pager debrief (what worked, what didn't, next bet).

## The Mindset Shift

**Junior:** "How do I solve this problem?"  
**Senior:** "Should we solve this problem? What's the simplest solution that moves the business forward?"

**Junior:** "My code works."  
**Senior:** "My code works, is maintainable, and helps my teammates move faster."

**Junior:** "I finished the feature."  
**Senior:** "I delivered value, measured impact, and learned something for next time."

The code quality will follow, but the judgment comes first.
