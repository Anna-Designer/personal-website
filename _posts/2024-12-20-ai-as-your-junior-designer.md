AI won't replace designers, but designers using AI will outpace those who don't. Treat AI like a junior teammate: great at volume, needs direction, and benefits from critique.

## The 7-step loop

1. **Clarify the job**

- Write a one-paragraph brief: user, goal, constraints, success metric.
- Feed real context: brand voice, token palette, sample copy, existing screens.

2. **Ideate wide**

- Generate 15â€“20 rough concepts in 10 minutes.
- Emphasize quantity over quality; filter later.

3. **Pick 3 directions**

- Choose diverse approaches: conservative, bold, wildcard.
- AI excels at variations once you give it a solid direction.

4. **Iterate fast**

- Use AI to explore micro-interactions, color schemes, layout alternatives.
- Describe changes in natural language: "Make this more premium" or "Add more breathing room."

5. **Stress-test assumptions**

- Ask AI to argue against your approach.
- Role-play user scenarios: "How would a colorblind user experience this?"

6. **Refine with constraints**

- Apply real-world limits: accessibility, brand guidelines, technical feasibility.
- AI can help check WCAG compliance or suggest mobile adaptations.

7. **Ship & learn**

- Use AI to help write design rationale and documentation.
- Generate multiple presentation formats for different stakeholders.

## What AI does well

- **Volume generation**: 50 button variants, 20 color palettes, 10 layout options
- **Copy iteration**: Headlines, microcopy, error messages
- **Accessibility checks**: Color contrast, alt text suggestions, focus order
- **Documentation**: Component specs, design rationale, user stories

## What requires human judgment

- **Strategy**: What problems should we solve?
- **Empathy**: How will users really feel?
- **Taste**: What feels right for this brand?
- **Integration**: How does this fit the broader experience?

## Tools worth trying

- **Midjourney/DALL-E**: Mood boards, illustration concepts
- **Claude/GPT**: Copy generation, accessibility audits
- **Figma AI**: Component variations, content generation
- **Framer AI**: Rapid prototyping, animation concepts

## A 30-minute sprint example

**Challenge**: Design a premium subscription onboarding flow

**Minutes 1-5**: Brief AI with user research, brand guidelines, competitor examples
**Minutes 6-15**: Generate 12 different flow concepts
**Minutes 16-20**: Pick 3 approaches, ask for detailed screens
**Minutes 21-25**: Iterate on the strongest direction
**Minutes 26-30**: Generate copy, accessibility notes, and handoff specs

## The collaboration mindset

Think of AI as an enthusiastic junior who:

- Never gets tired of iterations
- Has infinite reference knowledge
- Needs clear direction and feedback
- Excels at tedious tasks
- Benefits from your experience and taste

**Bottom line**: Use AI to think faster, not to think less.
