DataFlow Analytics needed to transform their complex analytics platform into an intuitive, powerful tool that business users could leverage without extensive training.

## Challenge

DataFlow's enterprise analytics platform was powerful but difficult to use:

- **Steep learning curve:** New users needed 2-3 weeks of training
- **Poor adoption:** Only 40% of licensed users were active monthly
- **Complex workflows:** Simple reports took 15+ clicks to create
- **Information overload:** Dense interfaces overwhelmed users
- **Mobile limitations:** No mobile access for executives on-the-go

The goal was to redesign the platform to be intuitive enough for business users while maintaining the power needed by data analysts.

## Research & Strategy

### User Research Deep Dive

- **Stakeholder interviews:** 25 users across 3 user types (executives, analysts, admins)
- **User shadowing:** 40 hours observing real workflow sessions
- **Survey research:** 200+ responses on pain points and feature usage
- **Competitive analysis:** 12 major BI platforms analyzed
- **Technical constraints:** Deep dive into backend capabilities and limitations

### User Personas Identified

**1. Executive Dashboards (30% of users)**

- Need: Quick insights and KPI monitoring
